# DeSign 

- The DeSign optimized BitTorrent's P2P data exchange and storage protocol.  It obtains data blocks from other files and compute the hash values, as long as the hash value of the data block is the same, the data content must be the same. 

- The DeSign is far more efficient than BitTorrent since it has a complete incentive mechanism to encourage data sharing. The credit value of a node will drop if it only does data receiving and not sending. Once the node's credit value goes down to a certain point, the node will be ignored by others and kicked out in the end.
