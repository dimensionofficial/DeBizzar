# DeCloud 

- The decentralized storage system, DeCloud, includes the DHT (distributed hash table) and builds a faster and safer block storage system with a higher throughput of block search. The DeCloud is implemented based on an innovative blockchain storage protocol - DeSign. 

- The packaged data will be heterogeneously processed by DeIPLD and then upload to the DeCloud, and its network will undertake the logic of storage system and P2P retrieval, and facilitate the data interexchange and interoperation among different systems. 

- By using a node-based network, the DeCloud provides the enterprise a better data storage and sharing services, without altering the data ownership and right.
