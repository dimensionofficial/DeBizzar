# Homomorphic Encryption  

The homomorphic encryption is a method of performing calculations without prior decryption of encrypted data. Dimension adopts the homomorphic encryption technology to encrypt the data and persist it on DeCloud, then performs complex processing on the specified encrypted data extraction through the smart contract. Only the final result data is decrypted and fed back, and the plain text is displayed. For the data consumer, the user can verify the authenticity and accuracy of the result data through the verification algorithm.
