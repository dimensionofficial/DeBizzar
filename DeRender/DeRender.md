# DeRender  

- The decentralized computing framework, DeRender, implement a true privacy calculation by overlaying homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computing (SMPC), to ensure the privacy of the input data and the computational logic. Meanwhile, verifiable computation also improves the performance of transaction processing and increases transaction throughput accordingly. The DeRender is scalable, verifiable and privacy-secured. It provides a basic computing framework for data sharing transactions and meets full demand for data privacy and security protection in enterprise-level services.  

- The data holders can share the data privately into DeRender, the decentralized computing framework, and at the same time, authorize DeCloud to access the new data source. When a new computing requirement is initiated, the collaborative computing network, DeRender, will confirm the calculation request, pass the execution code to multiple parties, and give the final result data back for confirmation. The whole process then transmits through a privacy protocol and this implements the collaborative data calculation of each computing node with privacy protection.
